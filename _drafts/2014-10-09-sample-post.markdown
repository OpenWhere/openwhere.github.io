# Instantiating Farts
To instantiate a fart, you must first insantiate the engineer class, which
acts as a fart generator.

{% highlight javascript %}
var andrew = new Engineer();
andrew.fart();
{% endhighlight %}

You can assign your farts to variables to store them for later.

{% highlight javascript %}
var andrew = new Engineer();

// Bottle your fart for later
var bottle = andrew.fart();
{% endhighlight %}

That's it! You are now the master of farts
